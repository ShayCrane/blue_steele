# Deploying Technology During New Hire Onboarding:

Our new hire onboarding process is initiated by an email from our client's HR department which will include the following information about the new hire:<br> 

- Full name, job title, office or workspace location, starting date; <br><br> 
- Technology/equipment required for job (ex: desktop, laptop, tablet, peripherals, desk phone, mobile phone, flash drives, etc.)<br><br>


Upon receipt of the above information, the following process is initiated:<br> 

1.   Order tech equipment requested in email with any special instructions (ex: rush order); 
2.  When we receive technology shipment, send email to client's HR to schedule appt for equipment delivery and install; 
3.  Install all tech equipment where necessary, including printers, peripheralsls, etc; 
4.  Configure devices for internet and network/fileshare access; 
5.  Configure email and all other applications with temporary passwords with on screen instructions to new hire to call helpdesk after first login for further instructions. 
5. Test all functionality of workspace technology; 
6. Once all is working, touch base with HR to give status of workspace before leaving (send email if not available, but send it from your mobile device before leaving the premises)<br><br><br><br>
