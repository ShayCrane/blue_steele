*Standard Operating Procedure*

*Purpose: to provide a uniform process for the receipt of technology purchase requests.*<br><br>

# Procedure for Handling Technology Purchase Requests:

- Our clients have all been supplied with our digital forms for technology purchase requests, which will include quantity, item name/description, price range, date needed by.

- Purchase requests are received and handled by our accounts payable department, who will perform the below procedures.

- Upon receipt of said form, ensure all technology requested: 

    - is compatible with the client's technology environment.
    - complies with the client's security needs.
    - is suitable for the needs stated on the purchase request form.
    - complies the client's pre-determined recurring technology cost budget, found in the client's file under "Budgets".<br><br>
 
- Accounts payable will purchase the item if it is compliant with the client's predetermined parameters from our approved vendors.  
     - The list of approved vendors is kept in accounts payable's database.<br><br>
        - If the technology requested does not meet the parameters, accounts payable will send an email with a copy of the request form attached to our point-of-contact for the client, with a brief but friendly message regarding the parameters, with a recommendation of another technology that may meet their needs and also complies with client's predetermined parameters. 
    - Once new request is received, repeat the steps above.<br><br>
