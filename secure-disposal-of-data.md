*Standard Operating Procedure*<br><br><br>

*Purpose: to provide a step-by-step solution for the media destruction process to ensure sensitive material and information is not recovered by unauthorized parties.*<br><br> 

# How to Securely Dispose of Sensitive Data from Storage Media:

Blue Steele, Inc. provides a secure drop box for media waiting for sanitization.  
- Bring the media to the box after receiving approval from your departmental supervisor, who will record the employee and device information in our sanitization records database.
- The sanitization service arrives to our offices by appointment, which will be scheduled by the records manager.
- The service will degauss all media and leave the storage media shells with the records manager for confirmation of data destruction.
- The records manager will destroy the media in our mini compactor and dispose of the fragments.<br><br>
