*Purpose: provides an overview the helpdesk support and ticketing procedure.*<br><br> 

# Receiving Support and Helpdesk Service Requests From Our Clients:

- Clients initiate support tickets by email at support@bluesteeleinc.com, which is managed by our helpdesk team, and an email autoresponse confirming our receipt of the support ticket is sent to the client.

- Tickets are claimed by our helpdesk team members in rotation.
	
- Begin the support process by marking the ticket priority in our system as one of the following classifications:
    1. Urgent
    2. High 
    3. Normal
    4. Low
		
- A personal response must be made to the client within 15 minutes of ticket receipt by the team member who claimed the support ticket*
    - *Except in the case of Urgent or High priority.  These cases must be responded to personally in no less than 5 minutes, to ensure the client that we are acting quickly <br><br> 

- Include in the first personal response any necessary follow up questions that will help to quickly solve the client's issue.

- Ticket resolution time** is based on the priority level of the ticket: 

    1. Urgent: 4 business hours
    2. High: 8 business hours
    3. Normal: 16 business hours
    3. Low: 32 business hours<br><br>

    - **Our clients are provided with this timeline upon their contracting of our services so that we can effectively manage expectations, thereby maintaining client satisfaction.<br><br>

- Helpdesk team members will consult the helpdesk binder supplied at each desk for flow charts of each type of support ticket and will follow the appropriate procedure laid out within.<br><br>
